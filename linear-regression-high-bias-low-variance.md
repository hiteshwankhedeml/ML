* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**The difference between line and actual points will always be there, so there will be high bias**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Even if we add more data the line wont change much, that means the variance of the line will be very less and that’s why its called as a low variance model**</mark>
