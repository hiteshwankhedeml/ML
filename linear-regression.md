# 🟢 Linear Regression

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Supervised**</mark>
* A is having some patterns, whereas B is not having any pattern
* In B we can divide it into 2 segments and then we can claim that there is some pattern
* Maybe after some pre-processing we will be able to find some pattern
* In A we can many solutions for line
* But we want to be able to <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**select the best line, which can generalize best**</mark>
* Y = mx + c 🡪 This is equation of a straight line
* If c = 0 then it means that line is going through the origin
* m represent the slope
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Using slope we understand for a unit change in x, how much is the change in y**</mark>
* If y = 0.5x then it means that for a unit change in x, y is changed by 0.5
* If x = 0 then y = c
