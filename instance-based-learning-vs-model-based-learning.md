* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Instance: If model is completely dependent on data, and for every prediction it is dependent on training data**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Model based: It tries to understand the pattern within the data and make a generalized model for prediction**</mark>
* Model based is far better than instance based
* Dataset:

| No. of hours of Play | No. of hours of study | Pass/Fail |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
|                      |                       |           |
|                      |                       |           |
|                      |                       |           |

* There can be some outliers also -> Someone study less still pass, some study more but still fail
* In instance based learning -> This will be like a domain expert
* When a new query comes, then the model knows training data, this model wont understand the pattern, it will just check the surrounding data
* If most of the points are pass then it will say that its Pass and vice versa
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Instance models: KNN**</mark>
* Same problem if we consider in model based learning, then the model will understand the pattern in the data

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Model based will try to create a decision boundary**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Here we create a generalized format to learn the data**</mark>
